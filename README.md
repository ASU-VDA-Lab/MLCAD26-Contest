# **LLM based Algorithm Discovery for OpenROAD Resizer **


Join the exciting MLCAD 2026 Contest and showcase your innovative skills in combining Agentic Large Language Model flows with electronic design automation (EDA). This year's challenge focuses on Algorithm discovery using LLMs and Agentic workflows for Electronic Design Automation.

**Winners of this year's contest will be invited to MLCAD2026 to present their solutions as a paper**

## Contest Overview

The goal of this contest is to create a design-aware Resizer within OpenROAD. Specifically, this means that the Resizer’s internal algorithms or source code may change depending on the design to which it is applied. Contestants begin with the baseline OpenROAD Resizer, whose source code and heuristics remain fixed across all designs.

Participants may use LLMs/Agentic Workflows or other methods to develop a new algorithms or optmize OpenROAD's existing resizers internal algorithms on a **per-design basis**

## Contest Challenges Include:

- Applying machine learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) for logic resynthesis.
- Ensuring physical awareness in resynthesis and ensuring routability without congestion overflows.
- Demonstrating timing improvements post global route by performing netlist optimizations post logic synthesis. 


## Updates:
We have extended the alpha submission deadline to June 15th.

## Why Participate?

- Showcase your AI-driven EDA innovations and state-of-the-art algorithms for physical-aware logic resynthesis. 
- Apply for **travel grants** (available for eligible participants) to MLCAD 2025.
- Winners will receive high-performance NVIDIA GPUs as prizes!
