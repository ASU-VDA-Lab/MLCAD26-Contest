# **LLM based Algorithm Discovery for OpenROAD Resizer **


Join the exciting MLCAD 2026 Contest and showcase your innovative skills in combining Agentic Large Language Model flows with electronic design automation (EDA). This year's challenge focuses on Algorithm discovery using LLMs and Agentic workflows for Electronic Design Automation.

**Winners of this year's contest will be invited to MLCAD2026 to present their solutions as a paper**

## Contest Overview

The goal of this contest is to create a design-aware Resizer within OpenROAD. Specifically, this means that the Resizer’s internal algorithms or source code may change depending on the design to which it is applied. Contestants begin with the baseline OpenROAD Resizer, whose source code and heuristics remain fixed across all designs.

Participants may use LLMs/Agentic Workflows or other methods to develop a new algorithms or optmize OpenROAD's existing resizers internal algorithms on a **per-design basis**

## Contest Challenges Include:

- Designing a design-adaptive timing optimization algorithm for OpenROAD that dynamically modifies strategies based on the characteristics of each design.
- Applying LLM-based or agentic optimization workflows to discover, generate, or evolve timing optimization moves beyond fixed heuristics.
- Demonstrating improved timing closure and overall design quality after placement legalization and global routing, while balancing power, routability, and runtime constraints. 


## Why Participate?

- Showcase your AI-driven EDA innovations and state-of-the-art algorithms for the Resizer. **Winners will have invited papers in the MLCAD 2026 Proceedings! **
- Apply for **travel grants** (available for eligible participants) to MLCAD 2026.
- Winners will receive high-performance NVIDIA GPUs as prizes!
